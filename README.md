# DataCamp Projects
Welcome to my DataCamp Projects folder!

As part of my data analytics journey, Iâ€™ve been exploring various datasets and building practical skills in SQL (and soon Python). This folder contains my completed projects, demonstrating my ability to query, analyse, and extract insights from data.
Projects are currently grouped by skill level.
